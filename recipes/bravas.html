        <h2 class="title">Description</h2>
        <p>This a common tapa in spain, but it has many variants. This one is very typical in Valencia, just fried potatoes with Allioli and a slight touch of paprika.</p>
        <p>It is also a very simple recipe, but hard to master.</p>
        <h2 class="title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes - 500 g</li>
            <li>1 spoonful of paprika</li>
            <li>Olive oil for frying - Around 200 ml (as needed)</li>
            <li>Allioli - around 200 g</li>
            <li>Salt - as desired</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the potatoes and clean them.</li>
            <li>Cut them in small dices, around 3 cm long.</li>
            <li>Heat a pan with olive oil at around 90 degrees C.</li>
            <li>Cook the potatoes until they are ready. We need them soft, but not crispy.</li>
            <li>To make them a bit crispy, put more heat when they are already cooked. Be careful not to burn them.</li>
            <li>Put them into a plate, with napkins at the bottom to absorb the excess oil.</li>
            <li>Add some salt as desired.</li>
            <li>Pour the allioli on top of them or at the side.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the paprika around the potatoes and more importantly on the allioli.</li>
        </ol>
