        <h2 class="title">Description</h2>
        <p>Authentic Paella Valenciana, since I am from Valencia. There are all sorts of dishes called Paella out there, but we valentians refer to most of them as "rice with things". There are some quite delicious but they just do not taste the same.</p>
        <p>In reality, the most important things are not mixing meat and fish, using the correct rice, and cooking it on a very thin pan (which is why the paella style pan is very useful).</p>
        <p>Every small town in Comunidad Valenciana has its own style of Paella but they always respect those principles. The one here is the most typical done in the Albufera Region.</p>
        <h2 class="title">Ingredients</h2>
        <h3><em>For 4 people</em></h3>

            <li>Duck or Rabbit - 300 g <em>- If this a taboo, well, more chicken I guess</em></li>
            <li>Spoonful of paprika</li>
            <li>Saffron or a small spoonful of orange colorant</li>
            <li>Twelve spoonfuls of natural tomato</li>
            <li>Romano beans or runner beans (green broad beans) - 400 g</li>
            <li>Lima or butter beans - 200 g</li>
            <li>Bomba Rice (Siena Rice preferable if possible) - 320 g</li>
            <li>3 or 4 artichoke hearts</li>
            <li>Olive oil - 150 g</li>
            <li>Rosemary - 10 g or so, seasoning</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Extra large frying pan or "paella"</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a paella.</li>
            <li>Sauté meat after seasoning with salt.</li>
            <li>Add green vegetables and sauté until soft.</li>
            <li>Add tomato, beans and artichoke.</li>
            <li>Add paprika and sauté.</li>
            <li>Add water, saffron (or food coloring), and rosemary. The water has to just cover the rice, do not add too much.</li>
            <li>Boil to make broth and allow it to reduce by half.</li>
            <li>Remove the rosemary once flavour has infused or it starts to fall apart.</li>
            <li>Add rice and simmer until rice is cooked and all water has evaporated. It is fine that the rice at the bottom is slightly burned (but not much!)</li>
        </ol>
