    <h1>Paella Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Authentic Paella Valenciana, since I am from Valencia. There are all sorts of dishes called Paella out there, but we valentians refer to most of them as "rice with things". There are some quite delicious but they just do not taste the same.</p>
    <p>In reality, the most important things are not mixing meat and fish, using the correct rice, and cooking it on a very thin pan (which is why the paella style pan is very useful).</p>
    <p>Every small town in Comunidad Valenciana has its own style of Paella but they always respect those principles. The one here is the most typical done in the Albufera Region.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
